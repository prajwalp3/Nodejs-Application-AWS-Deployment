This project demonstrates the process of deploying an application on AWS EC2. The following steps are covered:

#### IAM User Creation and Login: Setting up a secure user account with appropriate permissions.
#### EC2 Instance Creation: Launching an EC2 instance with recommended best practices.
#### EC2 Instance Access: Establishing a secure connection to the EC2 instance.
#### Application Deployment: Transferring and installing the application on the EC2 instance.
#### Application Exposure: Configuring the EC2 instance to make the application accessible from the internet.
#### Application Access: Verifying application functionality by accessing it from a local device.

Prerequisites
#### An AWS account
#### Basic understanding of Linux command-line
#### A developed application ready for deployment

Step-by-Step Guide
1. IAM User Creation and Login
Create an IAM user with programmatic access and attach necessary permissions (e.g., EC2 Full Access, S3 Full Access).
Generate access keys and secret access keys for the user.
Configure AWS CLI with the generated credentials.
2. EC2 Instance Creation
Choose an appropriate EC2 instance type based on application requirements (e.g., CPU, memory, storage).
Select a suitable Amazon Machine Image (AMI) matching the desired operating system.
Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic for SSH and required application ports.
Create a key pair for SSH access.
Launch the EC2 instance.
3. EC2 Instance Access
Use SSH to connect to the EC2 instance using the private key.
Verify connectivity and basic system information.
4. Application Deployment
Transfer the application files to the EC2 instance using SCP or other methods.
Install the application and its dependencies.
Configure the application as needed.
5. Application Exposure
Configure the EC2 instance's security group to allow inbound traffic on the application port.
Configure the application to listen on the specified port.
Consider using a load balancer or Elastic Beanstalk for more complex deployments.
6. Application Access
Determine the public DNS name or IP address of the EC2 instance.
Access the application from a web browser using the appropriate URL (e.g., http://public-dns:port).
Best Practices
Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication.
Regularly update EC2 instance and application software.
Implement security measures like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
Monitor resource utilization and costs.
Consider using AWS managed services for simplified deployments (e.g., Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda).
Additional Considerations
This guide provides a basic overview. Specific implementation details may vary based on application requirements and AWS environment configuration.
Refer to the official AWS documentation for in-depth information and troubleshooting.
Explore additional AWS services like Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch for advanced features.
